My current work continues off my previous work [generating AXI-wrappers](../axi-interface)
for programs in Verilog. In particular, I am interested in showing
that [Calyx](https://calyxir.org/) can help accelerate the development of interfaces and protocols generally.
To this end, I am working on [creating dynamically generated AXI-wrappers](https://github.com/cucapra/calyx/issues/1733)
implemented in Calyx. If you are interested in learning more about the work that is
in progress please visit the Calyx [repo](https://github.com/cucapra/calyx) or
[reach out](mailto:nathanielnrn99@gmail.com).
