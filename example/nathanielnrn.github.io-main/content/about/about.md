I'm a final-year undergraduate at Cornell University, graduating May 2024 with a
Bachelors in computer science and a minor in electrical and computer engineering.
I am a software engineer & aspiring researcher interested in computer architecture,
programming languages, and hardware software interfaces. I am currently working on
[Calyx](https://calyxir.org/) with the [Capra group](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/),
mentored by [Adrian Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/) and
[Rachit Nigam](https://rachit.pl/).

I previously interned at [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/), where
I worked on the Growth Engineering team to deliver backend functionality
to a variety of downstream services in the name of enabling
customer retention. I will be returning to Netflix at the end of Summer 2024.
Prior to  starting school I was an Air Defense Operator ("Interceptor") and
eventually a Drill Instructor in the Israeli Air Defense Command.

I hope to eventually continue my studies with a graduate degree. Please reach out
if you are interested in any of my [work](../projects).
